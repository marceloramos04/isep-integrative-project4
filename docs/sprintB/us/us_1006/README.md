# US 1006

## 1. Requirements & Specifications

### **US 1006** As Customer Manager, I want to display all the personal data of a candidate, including his/her applications.

> This user story contains both us1006a and us1006b. The first one is about displaying the details of a candidate and since the second one only adds displaying also the applications of a candidate, we considered those both the part of the whole candidate details.
