# US G002

## 1. Context

This task consists in the setup of a project management tool, in this case, the GitHub Projects.

## 2. Requirements

**US G002** As Project Manager, I want the team to use the defined project repository (i.e., GitHub) and setup a tool for project management.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- G002.1. In the project repository, a project management tool should be created. 

- G002.2. In order to better manage the project, the tool should have the following columns: To Do, In Progress, Testing and Done. Referring to the state of the tasks.

- G002.3. The tool should have all the tasks of the project, with the respective assignees, priorities, deadlines (the sprint they are a part of) and the task's estimated size.

**Dependencies/References:**

This project management tool came in use in order to change places with other tools like Trello or Jira (tools already used previously by the team).
