# US G001

## 1. Context
In the context of our project, it has been expressed a need for a some non functional requirements.This task is something that was introduced in this sprint and it is supposed to be done by the end of this sprint.
## 2. Requirements

*In this section you should present the functionality that is being developed, how do you understand it, as well as possible correlations to other requirements (i.e., dependencies). You should also add acceptance criteria.*

*Example*

**US G001** As Project Manager, I want the team to follow the technical constraints and concerns of the project

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* **AC1:** NFR01 - Programming language The solution should be implemented using Java as the main language. Other languages can be used in accordance with more specific requirements.
* **AC2:** NFR02 - Technical Documentation Project documentation should be always available on the project repository ("docs" folder, markdown format) and, when applicable, in accordance to the UML notation. The development process of every US (e.g.: analysis, design, testing, etc.) must be reported (as part of the documentation).
* **AC3:** NFR03 -Test-driven development The team should develop a relevant set of automated tests for every US / Class / Method. The team should aim to adopt a test-driven development approach.
* **AC4:** â€¢ NFR03 - Test-driven development The team should develop a relevant set of automated tests for every US / Class / Method. The team should aim to adopt a test-driven development approach.
* **AC5:** â€¢ NFR04 - Source Control The source code of the solution as well as all the documentation and related artifacts should be versioned in a GitHub repository to be provided to the students. Only the main (master/main) branch will be used (e.g., as a source for releases)
* **AC6:** â€¢ NFR05 - Continuous Integration The Github repository will provide night builds with publishing of results and metrics.
* **AC7:** â€¢ NFR06 - Deployment and Scripts The repository should include the necessary scripts to build and deploy the solution in a variety of systems (at least Linux and Windows). It should also include a readme.md, in the root folder explaining how to build, deploy and execute the solution.
* **AC8:** â€¢ NFR07 - Database By configuration, the system must support that data persistence is done either "in memory" or in a relational database (RDB). Although in-memory 15 3 Requirement database solutions can be used during development and testing, the solution must include a nal deployment where a persistent relational database is used. The system should have the ability to initialize some default data.
* **AC9:** â€¢ NFR08 - Authentication and Authorization The system must support and apply authentication and authorization for all its users and functionalities.


**Dependencies/References:**

*To make informed design decisions for the requirement, we attempted to implement the ones feasible with the available resources. It is understood that some requirements may only be achievable in subsequent sprints.
